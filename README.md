# 💻 C Language Practice Repository

This repository is a personal collection of studies, exercises, and mini projects developed in C. It includes content from university coursework, online programming courses (such as Alura and CS50), and independent challenges created to deepen my understanding of the C language.

## 📁 Repository Highlights

- 🎮 `Jogo_Domino` – Simple Domino game logic in C
- 🌱 `JogodaVida` – Implementation of Conway's Game of Life
- 🧠 `Mancalah_Game_Challenge_Softchail` – Mancala game developed for a team challenge
- 🏫 `PUC_Exercises` – Exercises from the Computer Science course at PUC-SP
- 🎯 `Projeto_Alura_C_I_Adivinhacao` – Guessing game from Alura's C course
- 🕹️ `Projeto_Alura_C_II_Forca` – Hangman game project
- 👾 `Projeto_Alura_C_III_PacMan` – Basic Pac-Man logic simulation
